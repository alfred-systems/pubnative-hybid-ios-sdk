 This method @b MUST @b be called by the adopter before the first usage of NumberEight SDK.
 We recommend that you call this from either:
    `application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` or
    `application:DidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
 methods of the AppDelegate class.
 
 @param key A developer API key granted by NumberEight.

 @param launchOptions The launchOptions from AppDelegate's application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.

 @param challenge This block is called whenever any iOS sensor needs permissions from the user.
 By implementing this single callback the adopter can handle these challenges
 by calling the related resolver object's requestAuthorization method, which will automatically prompt the user for the related permissions.
 If nil, then a default implementation will be used on these challenges, which just calls the resolver's requestAuthorization method for all cases.

 @param consentOptions Allows the user to provide affirmative consent to the various
 processing activities of the SDK.
 If the user is consents to the processing activities and the ability to
 store and access data on their device, use `ConsentOptions.withConsentToAll()`.
 If using an IAB TCFv2 string, call `ConsentOptions.withConsentString()`.

 @param handler This block is called when NumberEight has finished initialising.
 If the first parameter is false, then an NSError will be provided. Otherwise, the initialisation was successful.
